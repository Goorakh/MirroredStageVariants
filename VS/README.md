## Known issues (eg. May be fixed in future updates, if I can be bothered)

### Damage Numbers
Damage numbers do not render properly when mirrored, there are several flawed "solutions" in the mod you can pick from in the config. I will try to fix them properly but I have absolutely no idea how to do that, if you have any leads/experience in the field feel free to contact me (details below) :)

### Multiplayer
The mirrored state is not syncronized between players in multiplayer, each player rolls their mirror chance individually.

## Contact

If you have found a bug, or possess the lost knowledge of how the hell to modify the damage numbers, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Goorakh/MirroredStageVariants/issues/new) or DM me on Discord (@gorakh/Gorakh#0821)
